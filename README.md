**POSE IDENTIFICATION** is a computer vision task that infers the pose of a person or object in an mage or video.
 We can also think of pose identification as the problem of determining the position and orientation of a camera relative to a given person or object.

**TEACHABLE MACHINE**
    Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone.
    Teachable Machine 2.0 lets you train your own machine learning model with the click of a button, no coding required, and export it to websites, apps, physical machines and more. Teachable Machine 2.0 can also recognize sounds and poses, like whether you're standing or sitting down.

**TensorFlow.js**
    Teachable Machine uses TensorFlow. js, a library for machine learning in Javascript, to train and run the models you make in your web browser.TensorFlow. js is hardware-accelerated because it uses WebGL (a JavaScript graphics API), so it has surprisingly good performance.

**HTML**
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language
    HTML is the standard mark-up language for creating Web pages
    HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    HTML consists of a series of elements
    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


**JAVASCRIPT**
    JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt JavaScript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end software’s using different JavaScript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.
    JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. 
    JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage.

**STREAMLIT**
    Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps. So let’s get started!
    Streamlit's architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom.
    This can happen in two situations:
    Whenever you modify your app's source code.
    Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.
